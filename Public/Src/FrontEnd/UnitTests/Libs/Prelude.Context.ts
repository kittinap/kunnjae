     * Returns the BuildXL bin directory. 
     *
     * BuildXL bin directory is the directory of the executing bxl.exe. If server
     * mode is off, then the BuildXL bin directory is the directory where the user specified bxl.exe lives. 
     * However, if server mode is on, then the BuildXL bin directory is the BuildXL server deployment cache.
     *
     * BuildXL bin directory can be obtained by querying the mount table with "BuildXLBinPath" 
     * as the key, i.e., Context.getMount("BuildXLBinPath"). But such a query only works on
     * non-configuration file. On interpreting the configuration file, config.dsc, the engine
     * that carries the mount table has not been initialized. Thus, querying the mount table
     * will fail. This method can be used to get the bin directory during configuration parsing
     * and interpretation.
     *
     * This method is particularly introduced as a remedy of the issue concerning untracked
     * executables when users are consuming the released BuildSL SDK. Let us call the bin directory where 
     * the user specified bxl.exe lives the client bin directory, and call the server deployment cache
     * the server bin directory. Since users are not aware of the server bin directory, to consume the SDK,
     * users create a resolver pointing to the SDK that resides underneath the client bin directory. 
     * When the tools inside the SDK are launched, although those tools live in the client bin directory,
     * these tools are are marked as untracked because they do not live under any mount point. 
     * The expected mount point, BuildXLBinPath, actually points to the server bin directory.
