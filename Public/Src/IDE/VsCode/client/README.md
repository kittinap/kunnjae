Welcome to the Microsoft Build Accelerator DScript extension for Visual Studio Code - the productivity tool for anyone working with DScript!

In addition to standard features expected from a modern code editor like Syntax Highlighting and Automatic Statement Completion, this release adds the following features for DScript:

- Go to Definition (F12)
- Peek Definition (Alt+F12)
- Find All References (Shift+F12)
- Rename Symbol (F2)
- Change All Occurrences (Ctrl+F2)
- Format Document (Alt+Shift+F)

## What's New

- Improvements to the performance of Find All References.

## Version and Updates

- To find out which version of the DScript extension is installed under Visual Studio Code, look at the installed extensions (using Ctrl+Shift+X) and you should find the extension version number next to the extension name.
- Starting with this release, the DScript extension automatically checks for updates and presents you with a notification allowing you to upgrade to the latest version.
