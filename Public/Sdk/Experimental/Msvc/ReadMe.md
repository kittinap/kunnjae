# Work in progress
This is a very prelimenary sdk to get native code working in our selfhost.
Internal in Microsoft we have started work on a cleaner Sdk that supports cross targeting and multi platform for msvc, clang, gcc etc.
This Sdk is not ready yet and is tied to some internal components before we can publicaly release it.
