.SH NAME
sandbox-load \- Load BuildXLSandbox kernel extension for macOS
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sandbox-load
[--deploy-dir\fR \fIdeploy-dir\fR]
[--no-reload]
[--kext] \fIsrc-dir\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Loads a 'BuildXLSandbox' kernel extension from a given location.

If BuildXLSandbox extension is already loaded, depending on whether \fB--no-reload\fR was specified,
it either immediately exits or unloads the currently loaded extension and proceeds with loading the one
provided by the \fB--kext\fR switch.

If \fIdeploy-dir\fR is specified, \fIsrc-dir\fR is first copied into '\fIdeploy-dir\fR/BuildXLSandbox.kext',
which is then used as the location from which the extension is loaded.

Before loading, the owner of the final extension folder is changed to 'root:wheel' and its permissions are
set to '555'.  Finally, the extension is loaded from that folder using the 'kextload' utility.

Requires root privileges to execute 'kextload'.
