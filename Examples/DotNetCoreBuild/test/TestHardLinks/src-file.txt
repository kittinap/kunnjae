The 'testHardLink' tool will read the content of this file character by character.
After every read character, the tool will probe a different file, and then sleep 
for some short amount of time.  The length of this file, thus, affects the running
time of the test processes.

The purpose of all this is to test sandboxing when multiple processes are accessing
the same physical file via different hard links.
